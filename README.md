# Air Quality Monitoring Dashboard

**Frontend Home Assignment**

Build a web app for a network of low-cost particulate sensors (PM2.5 / PM10)
deployed across Berlin: two pages behind a shared app shell, in a light and a
dark theme. Each section below describes the purpose and expected features of one
UI component; the mockups are the reference for the rest.

## Constraints

The following technologies are required. Any additional libraries are at your
discretion.

| Technology         | Purpose                                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vite + Vue 3**   | Build tooling and framework.                         |
| **PrimeVue**       | UI component library.                                |
| **OpenStreetMap**  | Map tiles, via Leaflet or an equivalent Vue wrapper. |
| **Chart library**  | Your choice (e.g. Chart.js, Apache ECharts, ApexCharts). |

All shared UI elements (buttons, inputs, cards, badges, etc.) must be implemented
as dedicated project-level components sitting on top of PrimeVue primitives. Any
design change to a shared element should propagate across the entire interface
from a single edit point, with no need to touch individual views. Light and dark
come from one set of design tokens.

## Viewports

- **Desktop**, 16:9 / 16:10, ~1280×800 to 2560×1440 — the layout in the mockups.
- **iPad**, both orientations (down to ~768 px wide).

No phone layout is required, and there is no mockup for tablet sizes — that
adaptation is your call. No interaction may depend on hover alone.

## Data

The sample dataset (240 Berlin stations) lives in [`mock-data/`](mock-data/) and
is served by a tiny zero-dependency Node mock API. Start it with:

```
node frontend/mock-data/server.mjs      # http://localhost:8787
```

Consume the dashboard's data through these endpoints. All values are for
**Berlin** and in **µg/m³**.

- **`GET /stations?limit=20&after=<cursor>`** (or **`&before=<cursor>`**) — the
  station list, **cursor paginated in both directions**. Each response is
  `{ items: [...], pageInfo: { after?, before? } }`, where every station carries
  only its static identity: `id`, `district`, `location`, and map `coordinates`
  (`lat`/`lng`). `pageInfo.after` and `pageInfo.before` are opaque cursors: pass
  `after` back as `?after=` for the next page, `before` as `?before=` for the
  previous one. Each is **omitted when there is no page in that direction** (so a
  first page has no `before`, the last has no `after`). There is no page-number /
  offset access by design.
- **`GET /stations/count`** — `{ total }`, for the network-wide KPI.
- **`GET /stations/:id/readings?range=24h|7d|30d`** — a station's 30-day series
  of PM2.5 / PM10 readings, `[{ t, pm25, pm10 }, …]`, oldest first (`range`
  optional). This is the single source of truth for everything time-based: derive
  the current PM2.5 / PM10 / AQI, the 24-hour sparkline, and the 24H / 7D / 30D
  chart ranges from it. **A healthy station reports one reading per hour, on the
  hour.** A fully reliable station therefore has 720 readings over 30 days;
  missing hours are dropped submissions, and the share present vs. expected is
  its **stability %**.

The data is a fixed snapshot (no live updates); you do not need to poll or
mutate it. The underlying JSON files are in `mock-data/` for reference.

## Connection

One state per station, derived from its readings. The snapshot's most recent hour
is "now".

- **Offline** — no reading for the most recent expected hour, whatever the
  stability %.
- **Poor link** — reporting, stability below 86%.
- **HQ link** — reporting, stability 86% or better.

## 1 · Overview

Reference views at desktop width, in both themes.

| Light | Dark |
| ----- | ---- |
| ![Dashboard](dashboard.png) | ![Dashboard, dark theme](dashboard_dark.png) |
| ![Sensor list](sensors-list.png) | ![Sensor list, dark theme](sensors-list_dark.png) |

## 2 · App Shell

Persistent top bar: product name, tab nav between **Dashboard** and **Sensor
List**, theme toggle. Each page has its own URL. The theme covers the whole
interface — map tiles and chart included — and survives a reload.

## 3 · Header

Page title on the left; search field on the right for lookup by district name or
sensor ID.

## 4 · KPI Tiles

Dashboard only. Four summary cards giving an immediate read on network state:
Active Sensors (not offline), Avg PM2.5, Poor Connection (poor link), Network
Stability (mean stability % across the network).

## 5 · Sensor Map

Geographic overview of the sensor network. One marker per station, colour-coded
by AQI (green through red). Includes a PM2.5 / PM10 pollutant toggle; selecting a
marker updates the chart below.

The Air Quality Index legend:

- **Good** · 0–12
- **Moderate** · 12–35
- **Elevated** · 35–55
- **Unhealthy** · 55+

## 6 · Districts

Dashboard side panel: a short watchlist of tracked stations, not the full
network. Each row shows district, sensor ID and location, live PM2.5 with AQI
badge, 24-hour sparkline, PM10, connection state and stability %. Clicking a row
loads the station into the chart; **View all** goes to the Sensor List.

## 7 · Particulate Concentration Chart

Full-width time-series chart for the selected station. PM10 rendered as bars,
PM2.5 as an overlaid line, on a shared time axis. Range selector: 24H / 7D / 30D.

## 8 · Sensor List

The full station network as a table: **ID · District · Neighborhood
(`location`) · PM2.5 · PM10 · AQI · Connection**. Sortable by column; the
header's search filters it.

The collection is **cursor-paginated** (`GET /stations`, see §Data). Load it one
page at a time by following the cursors in `pageInfo` — forward with `after`,
backward with `before` — using next/previous controls (or infinite scroll, or
equivalent), showing a loading state and disabling navigation whenever the
corresponding cursor is absent. Do **not** walk every page up front to build one
big client-side list.
